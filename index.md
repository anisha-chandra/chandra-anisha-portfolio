## About Me
I am Anisha Chandra, a 12th student in the Honors
Computer Science program at Charlotte Latin. I am especially
interested in law and coding. Outside of class, I participate in
student council and debate. My favorite hobbies are walking and reading. In the
future, I hope to be a patent lawyer.
