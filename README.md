## About Me
I am Anisha Chandra, a 12th-grade student focusing on computer science and taking a data structures course this year. I enjoy debating and plan to pursue law after graduating. My interest in computer science stems from my creative nature, and I hope to combine both my cs and law interests in the future. With a speciality in patent law, I would utilize the technical aspects of cs in my career.
